# github.com/akash-network/akashjs is so bad and doesn't work.
# Start from scratch with the fastest most modern frameworks like daytona.io uses
# Make a whole new cryptoandcoffee/akash-jsdk that is a fully featured Akash Network sdk for javascript/react etc modern 2025 stuff
# And use protobuf, always check akash-network github for what we need but dont use it make our own.
